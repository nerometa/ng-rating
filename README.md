## My process

Angular received a new, big update! So I couldn't wait to implement it. This time I'm more keen of playing around this new update, how different it is to the previous version, etc. Might've been a bit overkill for this challenge, though.

### Built with

- [Angular 17](https://angular.dev)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

### What I learned

I learned a lot about new Angular updates and features, obviously. What's new to me is how it could be deploy. I decided to use Netlify to host it, since I heard it supported the latest version of Angular.

For Tailwind, it's the [`peer`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#styling-based-on-sibling-state) thing. Pretty useful.
